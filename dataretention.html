  <h1>Data Retention & Deletion Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>
    This application is a personal project used solely by the developer, Leonard Morris.
    Data retrieved from the Plaid API is retained only as long as necessary to support
    personal financial tracking and retirement planning.
  </p>

  <h2>Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Data can be deleted at any time by removing it from local storage or databases used by the application.
    No third-party consumers are affected.
  </p>

  <h2>Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    While this project is not a commercial service, the policy aligns with general principles of
    data minimization and storage limitation. Periodic reviews are performed to ensure that data
    is not stored longer than necessary.
